# Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset using SQL

I used a dataset from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.

A series of questions were answered regarding the data to help me profile and better understand the data. I came up with my own question for analysis and prepare a dataset for the analysis.

The questions require to write a variety of SQL statements.
