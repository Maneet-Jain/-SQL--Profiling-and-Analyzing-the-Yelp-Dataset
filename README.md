# Profiling-and-Analyzing-the-Yelp-Dataset

I will be using a dataset from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.

A series of questions will be answered regarding the data to help to me profile and better understand the data. I will come up with my own question for analysis and prepare a dataset for the analysis.

Naturally, the questions will require to write a variety of SQL statements.
